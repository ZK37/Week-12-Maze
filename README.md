# Week-12-Maze

Teleportation = Left trigger
Grab = Right Grip
Snap Look = Either joystick

Look for the red keycard.

I made the maze itself relatively simple so that I could focus more on the exterior environment, also it is the same environment asset package as my week 7 environment since it is already modular.  I made the teleportation path about half the with of the floor so that it is less likely that the user will walk through any walls or windows. I also noticed the teleportation is a little finicky, just keep the controller steady while clicking the trigger.
